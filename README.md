# General-Discussion
This repository serves as a starting point to discuss the general idea of Bridge-The-Divide.

Welcome to Bridge-The-Divide, an initiative dedicated to bridging societal gaps through the power of digital tools. In an era where digital forums often become echo chambers and deepen the divide between differing opinions. Our mission is to encourage understanding and dialogue. 

Through various innovative solutions like the **Forum_Insighter** plugin, we aim to make lengthy discussion threads more accessible, visualize the spectrum of perspectives, and enable a deeper comprehension of others' arguments. Our goal is to enrich online communication and lay the groundwork for constructive and inclusive discussions. Join Bridge-The-Divide, and help us bring the digital community closer together.

Other tools shall follow like Wikis and other collaborative text editors that highlight controversial text passages from whole chapters, and paragraphs down to single words to make it easy to find a common understanding of controversial issues.

Methods like 'nonviolent communication', 'sociocracy', or 'systemic consensus' shall be applied or get a digital toolset easily ot be implemented in various forums, social media, discord, and collaborative tools, ...

This is the general idea of this organization.

This repository shall serve as a starting point for the first collaborators to exchange their ideas in the associated Wiki.
So please don't write text here, but contribute to the Wiki instead.
